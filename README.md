Problem Statement:

● Design a Library Management System where users (students and librarians) can borrow,
return, and manage books.
● Book class should have title, author, bookId, isAvailable, number of copies data
members.
● Store book details and user details dynamically.
● Perform all the required operations to successfully operate a Library.
● Student and Librarian classes should be inherited from a common User class.
● Exceptions should be handled in an efficient way. Examples include “book not available”,
“invalid user exceptions”.
● Implement all the methods that are necessary to operate a library.

Additionally, added support for Fines, late submissions and registration of students and librarians. 
Used MySQL to store the data efficiently.
